__This "Don't be a jerk" policy is a shortened, casual version of the longer Code of Conduct policy.  
[Read the full version here.](http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_be_a_dick)__

### In a nutshell

GDGs pride themselves on being open, respectful, and inclusive communities. That means jerk behavior isn’t tolerated at meetings.

Here’s a reminder of the things we **strictly do not allow**:

- Jokes or offensive comments about sex, sexuality, race, religion, nationality or body size or shape;
- Display of pornographic images in public;
- Touching people uninvitedly;
- Continuing to interact with someone after they’ve asked you to stop.

Violating this policy&mdash;being a jerk&mdash;may result in getting expelled from GDG chapter or meeting.

Please join us with our goal of making our events awesome for everybody!
