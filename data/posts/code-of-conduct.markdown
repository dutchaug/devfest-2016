__This "Don't be a jerk" policy is a shortened, more casual version of the longer Code of Conduct policy. [Read full version](http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_be_a_dick).__

<br/>

GDGs pride themselves on being open, respectful, and inclusive communities. That means jerky behavior isn’t tolerated at meetings.

Here’s a reminder of the things we don’t allow: jokes or offensive comments about sex/sexuality/race/religion/nationality/body size or shape, showing pornographic images in public, touching people uninvited, or continuing to interact with someone after they’ve asked you to stop.

"Jerk behavior" may result in getting expelled from GDG chapter or meeting.

If someone is bothering you, please tell any organizer immediately and allow them to take care of addressing it. Our goal is to make our events awesomely jerk-free!
